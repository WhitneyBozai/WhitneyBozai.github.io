        <p>I design a clock that changes with my mood, it not only change color, but also its speed. When I am excited, the clock is red and runs very fast; When I'm happy, the clock turns pink and runs slower; When I'm relaxed, the clock turns blue and continues to slow down; When I get bored, the clock turns gray and runs at a minimum speed.When I started to design the clock, I came up with a clock that record my daily routine and a clock that record one day of my dog, but I thought  a clock that shows how I feel about the passage of time is more interesting.In this assignment, I am really happy that I learned about how to make a small animation in P5.</p>
