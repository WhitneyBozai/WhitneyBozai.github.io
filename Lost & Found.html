        <p>It is a pair of HUAWEI earbuds is enclosed in a matte silver case. The case has an oval shape but is a little bit flat. You can imagine the shape of it like this: you slap a dough on a table. The case opening area is a parabolic curve above the curve where it marked the small HUAWEI text on top of it in black color. Under the curve is where it has grey dots for Bluetooth signaling. On the right side of the grey dot is a flat grey button that you can press to enable the Bluetooth function.</p>
